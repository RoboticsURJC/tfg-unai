%ENGLISH:
%First paragraph (Introduction):
Robotics is a broad field that has been developed with the aim of improving the
people's quality of life in numerous areas.
There is a wide variety of robots, each dedicated to a specific purpose,
generally matching or surpassing human performance, even working continuously
without the need for rest and eliminating risks.

%Second paragraph (Objectives):
In the educational field, with the growing trend of including robotics in the
curriculum, ROS is the most widely used software. However, due to its
complexity, it is difficult to learn, creating an educational gap in this field.
Another major issue with this software lies in the use of DDS, a communication
protocol that generates a large number of messages, which can saturate the
network.

%Third paragraph (Development Platform):
This work aims to address these problems by using hardware platforms, such as
the Turtlebot 2 and 4 robots, and software tools, like Zenoh-Flow, creating a
data flow programming environment compatible with existing ROS2 nodes, making it
more accessible to students in this field.

%Fourth paragraph (Software Architecture with Zenoh and ROS2):
Zenoh-Flow, the main software tool used, was linked with ROS2, leveraging
Zenoh-bridge-DDS's capability to translate messages bidirectionally between
Zenoh and DDS protocols.

%Fifth paragraph (Experiments and Conclusions):
Numerous experiments were conducted on an application created following the data
flow programming paradigm with Zenoh-Flow.
In it, several robots must search for and approach an object in an organized
manner, dividing the map equitably and optimizing area sweeping trajectories, so
that the robot that finds the object communicates its position to the rest.
This was achieved in simulation and, partially (due to external errors), in a
real laboratory environment, demonstrating the viability of data flow
programming in robotics and its compatibility with ROS2.
Likewise, these experiments also demonstrate its simplicity, an indispensable
requirement for its application in pre-university robotics education, helping to
reduce the educational gap in this field.
